# Shopify Simulator Documentation

Welcome to **Shopify Simulator**, a lightweight environment designed to help developers explore Shopify's Liquid templating language and dynamic section-based architecture. This project simulates Shopify's core functionalities, enabling developers to practice creating reusable components, iterating through data, and working with dynamic settings.

## **Liquid Basics**

Liquid is a templating language used in Shopify to dynamically render content. Below are the key concepts you'll use in this simulator:

### **Sections**

Sections are modular components that render specific parts of a page. For example, the `featured-products.liquid` file is a section that displays a list of products. Sections can:

- Access dynamic data from `settings_data.json`.
- Be configured through a schema defined in `settings_schema.json`.

Example:

```liquid
<section class="featured-products">
  <h2>{{ settings['featured-products'].settings.heading }}</h2>
</section>
```

### **Snippets**

Snippets are reusable components, such as a product card. You can include a snippet using the `{% render %}` tag:

Example:

```liquid
<div class="product-list">
  {% for product in products %}
    {% render 'product-card', product: product %}
  {% endfor %}
</div>
```

### **Iterating Over Objects**

Liquid allows you to iterate over arrays, such as products or collections:

```liquid
<ul>
  {% for product in products %}
    <li>{{ product.title }} - ${{ product.price }}</li>
  {% endfor %}
</ul>
```

### **Filters**

Filters are used to manipulate output. Some common filters:

- `capitalize`: Capitalizes the first letter.
- `date`: Formats a date.
- `money`: Formats a number as currency.

Example:

```liquid
{{ product.price | money }}
{{ product.created_at | date: "%B %d, %Y" }}
```

## **Dynamic Configuration**

### **Schema (`settings_schema.json`)**

The schema defines the settings available for a section. While it's necessary in Shopify, it might not be required here.

### **Data (`settings_data.json`)**

This file contains the dynamic values for settings

## **Setup Instructions**

### **Install Dependencies**

```bash
npm install
```

### **Run the Server**

```bash
npm start
```

### **Build Styles and Scripts**

```bash
npm run build
```

---

## **Additional Notes**

### **Assets**

All product, banner, and collection images are stored in the `/assets` folder. Refer to the `data/products.json` and `data/collections.json` files for mappings.

### **Testing the Application**

Visit `http://localhost:3000` in your browser to view the simulator in action.
